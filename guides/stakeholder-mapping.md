# Stakeholder Mapping for Staff+ Engineers

## Why Stakeholder Mapping Matters

As a Staff+ engineer, you can't succeed alone. Your impact depends on:
- Getting buy-in for technical decisions
- Securing resources
- Coordinating across teams
- Managing competing priorities

## What is a Stakeholder?

**Anyone who:**
- Affects your work
- Is affected by your work
- Controls resources you need
- Can block or accelerate your initiatives

## Stakeholder Mapping Framework

### 1. Identify Stakeholders
- Direct stakeholders (work directly with)
- Indirect stakeholders (affected but not direct)
- Decision makers (approve/block)
- Influencers (no direct authority but influential)

### 2. Assess Power & Interest

**Power-Interest Grid:**

```
        High Interest
             ↑
  ┌──────────┼──────────┐
  │  MANAGE  │  ENGAGE  │
  │  CLOSELY │  CLOSELY │
  ├──────────┼──────────┤
  │  MONITOR │ KEEP     │
  │          │ INFORMED │
  └──────────┼──────────┘
Low Power   →  High Power
```

**Strategy by quadrant:**

**Engage Closely (High Power, High Interest):**
- Key decision makers, regular updates, involve in decisions

**Manage Closely (Low Power, High Interest):**
- Keep informed, address their concerns, use as advocates

**Keep Informed (High Power, Low Interest):**
- Periodic updates, brief and high-level

**Monitor (Low Power, Low Interest):**
- General awareness, minimal effort

### 3. Understand Motivations
For each key stakeholder, document:
- Goals & priorities
- Pain points
- Success metrics
- Communication preferences
- How your project helps them
- Their concerns/risks

### 4. Map Relationships
Understand who influences whom and organizational dynamics.

### 5. Create Engagement Plan
Define frequency, channels, and messaging for each stakeholder.

## Influence Strategies

### 1. Build Relationships Early
Build trust before you need favors.

### 2. Speak Their Language
Tailor message to audience (Engineer vs PM vs Executive).

### 3. Build Coalition
Find allies and champions who will advocate for you.

### 4. Address Concerns Proactively
Anticipate objections and have responses ready.

### 5. Make It Easy to Say Yes
Remove friction, provide clear proposals, ask for specific decisions.

## Key Takeaways

**Stakeholder management is:**
- Essential for Staff+ success
- Ongoing, not one-time
- About relationships, not manipulation
- Win-win, not zero-sum

**Best practices:**
1. Map stakeholders early
2. Understand motivations
3. Build relationships before you need them
4. Communicate proactively
5. Make it easy to support you

**Start mapping your stakeholders today. Your next project's success depends on it.**
