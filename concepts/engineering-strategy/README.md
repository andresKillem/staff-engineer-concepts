# Engineering Strategy

## What is Engineering Strategy?

Engineering strategy is the long-term plan that guides technical decisions and investments to achieve business goals. It's the "why" behind your technical choices.

## Why Strategy Matters

Without strategy:
- Teams build conflicting solutions
- Tech debt accumulates randomly
- Resources are wasted on non-priorities
- Company can't scale effectively

With strategy:
- Clear technical direction
- Aligned team efforts
- Better resource allocation
- Sustainable growth

## Components of Engineering Strategy

### 1. Vision (Where we're going)

**Good vision statement:**
> "We will have a platform that allows any team to deploy globally in under 10 minutes with 99.99% reliability."

**Bad vision statement:**
> "We will use Kubernetes."

**Key elements:**
- **Ambitious but achievable**
- **Time-bound** (1-3 years)
- **Measurable outcomes**
- **Business-aligned**

### 2. Current State Assessment (Where we are)

**Technical inventory:**
- Existing systems and technologies
- Technical debt and pain points
- Team capabilities and gaps
- Infrastructure and tooling

**Example assessment:**
```markdown
## Current State (2025)

### Systems
- 50+ microservices (Python, Go, Node.js)
- Deployed on AWS ECS
- PostgreSQL + Redis
- REST APIs

### Pain Points
- Deploy time: 45 minutes average
- No automated rollbacks
- Manual database migrations
- Inconsistent logging/monitoring
- Team expertise concentrated in few people

### Strengths
- Good test coverage (80%+)
- Clear service boundaries
- Active on-call rotation
```

### 3. Strategic Initiatives (How we get there)

Break vision into executable initiatives:

```markdown
## Strategic Initiatives (Next 12 months)

### 1. Platform Modernization
- **Goal**: Reduce deploy time to <10 minutes
- **Why**: Developer productivity, faster iteration
- **How**:
  - Migrate to Kubernetes (Q1-Q2)
  - Implement GitOps (Q2)
  - Automated canary deployments (Q3)
- **Success Metrics**:
  - Deploy time <10min (from 45min)
  - Rollback time <2min (from 30min)
  - Zero-downtime deployments: 100%

### 2. Observability
- **Goal**: <5 min time-to-detect production issues
- **Why**: Reduce customer impact, improve reliability
- **How**:
  - Centralized logging (Q1)
  - Distributed tracing (Q2)
  - Custom dashboards per team (Q2-Q3)
- **Success Metrics**:
  - MTTD (Mean Time To Detect) <5min
  - MTTR (Mean Time To Resolve) <30min
```

### 4. Guiding Principles

Technical decision-making framework:

**Example principles:**

1. **Build vs Buy**
   - Default to buy/OSS unless core differentiator
   - Build only what provides competitive advantage

2. **Technology Choices**
   - Prefer proven over bleeding-edge
   - Standardize on 2-3 languages max
   - Document exceptions

3. **Reliability**
   - SLO-driven development
   - Automated testing required
   - Blameless postmortems

4. **Security**
   - Secure by default
   - Least privilege access
   - Regular security audits

## Writing Effective Strategy

### Do:
- **Start with "why"**: Connect to business goals
- **Be specific**: "Deploy in <10min" not "faster deploys"
- **Include metrics**: How you'll measure success
- **Prioritize ruthlessly**: 3-5 themes max
- **Make it actionable**: Clear next steps
- **Get buy-in**: Involve stakeholders early

### Don't:
- **Technology for technology's sake**: "Let's use GraphQL" (why?)
- **Boil the ocean**: Too many initiatives
- **Ignore constraints**: Budget, team size, time
- **Set and forget**: Strategy needs regular updates
- **Write alone**: Need diverse perspectives

## Common Patterns

### Migration Strategy

```markdown
## Database Migration: Postgres â†’ DynamoDB

### Why
- Scale to 10x traffic
- Reduce operational burden
- Cost savings ($50K/month)

### Approach
- Dual-write pattern
- Service-by-service migration
- Read-only verification period

### Timeline
- Q1: Proof of concept (1 service)
- Q2: Migration tooling
- Q3-Q4: Migrate all services
- Q1 next year: Deprecate Postgres

### Risks
- Data consistency during transition
- Team learning curve
- Performance regressions

### Success Criteria
- All services on DynamoDB
- <100ms p99 latency
- Zero data loss
- Team comfortable with new system
```

### Platform Strategy

```markdown
## Developer Platform Strategy

### Vision
Self-service platform where any engineer can:
- Deploy new service in 1 day
- Get monitoring/alerting automatically
- Access production safely
- Debug issues independently

### Current Pain
- Manual infrastructure setup (weeks)
- No standardized tooling
- Tribal knowledge
- Support bottleneck (platform team)

### Solution
**Internal Developer Platform (IDP)**
- Service templates
- Automated pipelines
- Centralized observability
- Self-service troubleshooting

### Execution
Year 1: Core platform

- Quick wins

**Quarterly:**
- Adjust priorities
- Add/remove initiatives
- Update timelines

**Annually:**
- Full strategy refresh
- Assess outcomes
- Set next year's direction

## Summary

**Great strategy has:**
1. Clear connection to business goals
2. Honest assessment of current state
3. Specific, measurable initiatives
4. Guiding principles for decisions
5. Stakeholder buy-in
6. Regular review and adjustment

**As a Staff+ engineer:**
- You define or heavily influence strategy
- You communicate it effectively
- You ensure execution aligns with strategy
- You adjust based on learnings

**Remember:**
> "Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat." - Sun Tzu

Applied to engineering:
- Strategy: What we're building and why
- Tactics: How we're building it

Both are essential. Staff+ engineers excel at connecting them.
