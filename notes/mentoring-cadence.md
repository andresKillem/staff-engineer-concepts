## Mentoring Cadence (Lightweight)

- Weekly 30-min sync: unblock, set one goal, one practice rep
- Bi-weekly deep-dive: system design, debugging narrative, or doc review
- Monthly retro: wins, misses, next focus; refresh growth plan
- Artifacts: keep a rolling doc with links to PRs, design docs, incidents
- Boundaries: coaching over coding; avoid doing the work for them
