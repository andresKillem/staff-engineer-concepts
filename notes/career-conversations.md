## Career Conversations (Quarterly)

- Frame around impact, scope, and leverage; avoid title-chasing
- Three prompts: what changed, what got better, what you unblocked
- Map next-step bets: 1 delivery bet, 1 platform/system bet, 1 people bet
- Risks to surface: blind spots, succession for your area, debt you own
- Artifacts: keep a log of deltas, decisions, and deltas you influenced
